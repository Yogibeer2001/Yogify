# Yogi

When new to rails getting used to error codes and debugging is quite helpful.
to practice your debugging skills you can use this gem.

Currently are just the activate and the fixme function working.
to later stage a checkme will be included to keep track of your debugging progress.

latest stable version 0.2.4.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'yogi'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install yogi

## Usage

type "activate" to generate some errors in your rails project...happy debugging..(to check yourself type "checkme" ** not working jet**)

sick of debugging type "fixme"
